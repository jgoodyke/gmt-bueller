<h1 class="bd-title" id="content">Software Development Evaluation Problem</h1>
<br>
<p class="bd-lead">
  This exercise is to help us understand how you go about solving a problem, and what methodologies and techniques you used to solve it.<br>
  <br>
  When you come in for your interview you will be asked to give a presentation on this project. What you talk about in this is up to you. We are
  looking to see how you solve problems, and how you present findings to a group.

<h2>Problem Description</h2>

  We have included a dataset that represents achievement in secondary education in a school. The data attributes include student grades,
  demographic, social and school related features. The dataset is a comma delimited file (CSV). Its attributes can be defined as follows:<br>

  <li>romantic - with a romantic relationship (binary: yes or no)</li>
  <li>famrel - quality of family relationships (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - excellent)</li>
  <li>freetime - free time after school (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)</li>
  <li>goout - going out with friends (numeric: from 1 - very low to 5 - very high)</li>

  <li>health - current health status (numeric: from 1 - very bad to 5 - very good)</li>
  <li>absences - number of school absences (numeric: from 0 to 93)</li>
  <li>G1 - first period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)</li>
  <li>G2 - second period grade (numeric: from 0 to 20)</li>
  <li>G3 - final grade (numeric: from 0 to 20, output target)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Requirements for the Program</h2>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>All data provided for charts and tables must come from a query to a backend datastore</li>
  <li>The application you develop and show us must be web based client access.</li>
  <li>
    Charts/graphs required
    <ul>
      <li>
        Provide a visualization that will show the average final grade based upon the user selecting one of the following options
        <ul>
          <li>did you have internet access</li>
          <li>number past failures</li>
          <li>your study time</li>
          <li>absences</li>
          <li>So, if I select "internet access" I should see a result that gives average with internet access, and average without internet access</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A graph that would correlate overall health to final grade
        <ul>
          <li>Please feel free to group datapoints into categories (see item 29 or 14 for examples) if it makes sense to do so.</li>
          <li>Bonus if you can show, or explain to us a way we can see the G1, G2, and G3 Grades in a graph corresponding to overall health of the student</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A chart that will show how travel time (traveltime) affects the overall grade.</li>
      <li>As a bonus any other charts or graphs that you found interesting from the data you were given.li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2>Additional Information</h2>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>You can use any programming tools you are most comfortable with. Be prepared to explain your choice of tools.</li>
  <li>As you look at charts and graphs for this, take a look at what are the current practices for the web, and how do you make a compelling
      chart. chartjs.org, nvd3.org, d3js.org, Google Charts can all provide inspiration and frameworks for you to use. We really like it when the
      visualization tells the story.</li>
  <li>You can use any database of your choice (MySQL, SQLExpress, Microsoft SQL Server, Postgres, MongoDB, etc...).</li>
  <li>I recommend you bring your laptop if available to show your work on. If you don't have a laptop then put your work on a thumb drive, or
      on github. You will be provided a windows 8 machine to show us your results.</li>
  <li>A projector screen will be provided for you to connect to for your presentation</li>
  <li>When you arrive for your onsite interview you will be given the opportunity to present your results to the group that will be interviewing
      you. We understand that we are asking you to develop a software solution on top of your already hectic schedule. We are looking for
      how you approached the problem, and how you communicate how you solved it. We will not do an in depth analysis of your code, but
      we welcome you to show us your work and what you did.</li>
  <li>You will also have a whiteboard if you wish to explain anything in detail to us.</li>
